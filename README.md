## About

This website has been created for making the functioning of a society/association easier.
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic ,social gatherings are not possible and therefore processes like collection of money,registering complaints of society members,taking suggestions,managing expenditures of society can’t be performed.
But these processes are important for functioning of a society and hence can’t be stopped.
So,this website gives solution to this problem by providing an online platform to carry out processes like these.
This website has the following functionalities :

- The users can register their complaints about anything to the admin.
- The users can give suggestions about anything .
- the users can make the payments online using this website .
- the users can also maintain a track of their complaints and suggestions so that they know whether required actions were taken or not.
- the users can also track the expenses of the society which makes the process really transparent because now the society members can see where and how the money is being spent.
- there’s a notification section as well where the society members can see all the important notifications.
- the website also provides a platform to all the society members to interact with each other by sending personal notification (complaints,suggestions or anything).

<!-- ## Installation Prerequisites

- Nodejs

> To Download Nodejs Package [Go to the Nodejs Download Website](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

- Mongodb

> To install Mongodb [Go to this Website](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/install-community/) -->

<!-- ## How to Run this Website

1. Clone this Repo to your Local Machine.
2. Open The Terminal/CMD in the folder Janhit-Welfare.
3. Type `mongod` in your Terminal to Run mongodb Server (Ignore if already Running).
4. Type `cd backend/jwa && npm install` to download all the library.
5. Type `npm start` to run the nodejs server.
6. Open [localhost:300](localhost:3000/) in your browser.
7. Enjoy!!! :tada: :sparkles: -->

## Problem

In India over 70 percent of the rural household depend on Agriculture. It is important to give the farmers the right value of their produce depending on the quality. It has been observed that many farmers don’t even get the Minimum Support Price (MSP) for their produce due to the ill practices used by middlemen who are continuously widening the gap between the pay to farmers and the price taken from the customer. -->

<!-- ## Idea

- The main idea is to build an application which will use the camera of mobile to determine the crop quality which can be used to predict the value of crops.
- Computer Vision (Machine Learning/Artificial Intelligence) will be used to determine the quality of the crop using the different visible features of the crop.
- This can enable farmers to get the right price of their crops based on their quality without any middlemen.
- Traders (middlemen) can buy crops on the platform only at prices determined by the model. This will ensure that farmers are not exploited by the traders.
- Building such a platform will enable the government to analyze the data from different farmers across the country and advice farmers accordingly.
- The practices used by the farmers producing good quality crops can be shared with others by integrating a platform like “StackOverflow” where farmers/government can post about the good practices. -->

<!-- ## Implementation Plan

- Determine quality of crop/produce using the image of crop.
- Building application with features like question addition, deletion and updation, answering question, image uploading.
- Integrate quality determination model to platform.
- (Optional) Platform for analysis of gathered data. -->

<!-- ## Dataset Description

The dataset consists of images of wheat grains organised into five folders - grain, damaged_grain, foreign, broken_grain, grain_cover.

- **Grain** - contains images of healthy wheat grains
